  "text": " Is the tail urgent or can I call you back? Right. Yeah, so I think it's like of the macro piece, it's like these three values matter for all of humankind. Yeah. So that's what we're working on, you know, and I'd call it a 30-year knowledge project that's like two-thirds of the way through. Yeah. You know, it is our forces of the countries that we've been to and the places and locations, like just some of that richness we kind of land way through. Here's our sources of the countries that we've been to and the places and locations, just some of that richness we kind of land on it. And then here are the eight, in terms of the business cases, here are the ways that we can shift the game. If we have, I'm convinced corporations become joy corps it's 80 of the job done and like they can be met by in schools like all these ones all like the five activations are fucking totally right the system change residencies are totally right and then the tools like a series of 150 different levers which i'd call like i think mental credit is a tool. So it's just getting a list of tools to go, here are a bunch of tools that allow us to shift from out of relation to in relation. And these will be the data resources, but then we can see the individual value. So all the business cases you'll just be searching, there'll be 156 categories. No, there'll be more. It came up with that before, yeah. There'll be more because there'll be the system change residents, there'll be 130 in total. So there'll be 150 tools, there'll be 280. Like every system change residency will have its own because it's its own tool and its own business case for that body of work, like its own TED Talk world. But if you think about Fuckman, if we just do that presentation really well because it's its own tool and its own business case for that body of work, like its own TED Talk world. But you think about, fuck, man, if we just do that presentation really well as a video, then input that into here, what we can create for those systems change residents in terms of visualisation. So, yeah, the five action Bs is super deep. The systems change residents, like, get their block with 130 projects, then the 150 tools, all of their own individual categories. That's the view of which you'll be able to look through the Knowledge Hub for the next seven years, and it'll be that match with the historical knowledge that's come through, that's there, everyone search around. I think there's... So so there's the feed in. That would be really interesting to go. This is where we're at two-thirds of the way in. And here's what we know, like predictive will be the category areas. So this is our R&D project for humankind. And here are some of the themes. Like we're looking at earthshot projects, but we don't know specifically like we're looking at ones looking at energy, looking at materials, looking at different things. And we're looking at people inside the major economies shifting the way capital works we know we're working towards 125 trillion like we actually know some of our broader architecture anchor points um and then what's really interesting for me bro is it's like i i think this is then the shop we finally have your fucking shop credit like so someone unlocks all this stuff don't this inside imagination we track it really deeply but someone can just come and do all the things they do the things they get the credit they can buy a fucking hoodie yeah that's yeah and they just buy a hoodie. And the logic's already, the thing I'm trying to work out is like the logic's already 80% there, but you need 20% human intervention to be able to finalise it. And as you were just talking, there's this idea of weighting the knowledge. And so what you're doing right now is weighting knowledge. Yeah. And so you put that in weighted higher than the rest of it. Yeah. And then that creates the homepage. Yeah. Because that's the latest, highest weighted knowledge. And then it then goes into historical categorization of that and but all the all the trails all those things like the fucking default settings every every video volume like they're yeah they're all just like so yes to before but what you're trying to like this is the imagination pledge or the death pledge yeah like that this is that this is the imagination pledge or the death pledge. Yeah. Like this is that times the factor of 2,700, 700, you know, or whatever. It's then in context. So someone can come and like an organisation can take the death pledge worth 90 points and buy their own fucking custom-made hoodie and we make a death hoodie for them. Of course. Yeah. You know, you you actually can match it to the hoodies if you get the shop check out so then the input we don't have to sweat the detail because we know we've done the stuff in the middle yeah like no ai is going to like spin in ways that sometimes a bit odd but for the most part you're like actually that's the part where we're not gonna we're gonna sweat the input and we sweat the output which is like did you collect 50 points you know and for some it might be like for the death pledge that's not they go to the knowledge or do these things but it's just the action we're interested in you know are you going to create a biomass measurement of your house yeah on that into the earth i created a biomatch management like are you going to claim imagination minutes in nature you know and and that that laddering up like that's how you move the 18 000 hoodies and then my god like what an amazing fucking data point to be like this is what we like you know in damon's film last night they were like oh what do you do with um you know how do you use fashion for good nike could fucking use this like nike could use this with the fucking air earth shoe and you could go this is what you do you do all these knowledge stack or we can just give you the knowledge like in terms of the knowledge stack you can just take this and you can have a set of challenges that people do and you can, you know, if you want other people that can feed in, but then you just do the points and this is your moneyless shop. Like, this is the moneyless shop. And it's just so fucking cool that we can get to that. And there's a shitload of stuff with AI which is so fucked up that, my God, it's allowed us to land. But I just think, to be clear too, I'm super worried about AI in terms of people using it because people are accessing a world's worth of knowledge and trying to contextualise their own world, whereas A aim is ahead of the game because we are using our knowledge as a large language model that um actually takes back control of the knowledge because it's weighted more towards what we already have done versus just rolling down a river, right, and falling off a waterfall. We almost like, I don't know what the analogy is, like we've built the raft to be able to like float down the river and people can jump on because we've built that ecosystem architecture. It's exactly what, yeah, it's the film works because you're animating existing knowledge which is tough to translate because it has complexity and and so it's that you know a hoodie shop doesn't exist yet but we know what we want we're not asking what do we do with all this like we know we want a moneyless shop we know we want a hoodie to use fashion differently we know we want a case study but it's like what's fucking astounding here is Wikipedia, like it's like trusted knowledge sources, good partner with Nike, and say this is trusted, verified knowledge banks. You know, this is Khan Academy's knowledge bank and it's Khan Academy and Patagonia. You know, we're doing, like it moves, it makes the product relational and that's the prize like we have so for fucking if we just put like 10 there's 10 000 hoodies remaining on the shop um our moneyless shop is now open and off you go like you know when you get the remote communities different places wherever you go hey you want to get a hoodie? Like, you can do this. Yeah. And it's almost like you're giving them access to knowledge that is hard to find but packaging it up in whatever way is relatable to them to be able to use. That's where the AI world, like, I can search in words I understand. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. And I can ask, can you translate this to French? Like, you can, it can. You know, I can fucking, I can get, I can find my way into the middle of this stuff in something, and I can find, ask a series of questions, which is just, it's just Socrates by again. But it's, yeah, I reckon that's, I think that, I think that is totally the prize. Yeah. Have you showed Andres? Mate, I literally finished it yesterday in the car. Well, I mean, this is... Are you driving the car at the same time? No. This is probably... This is probably like 20 hours of coding, I reckon, at least over a couple of weeks. And that's like, you know what I mean, full tilt. But it's like a... It's like you know man full tilt but it's like a it's like a um um it's like a scaffolding because as soon as you get to that right repository and data lake everything else is easier because it can continue to contextualize the next steps well all the stuff i mean where that our biggest challenge is all of its fucking you know all the mowers all these things they're just fucking so rich yeah but then we're not going to compete and that's also like i didn't we can't we can't compete in the transaction i'm not gonna beat spotify's dumb fuck like um but if the mower is for knowledge yeah if the dreams research things are not to compete with Instagram, it's for knowledge, then you're doing what we wanted to do, which is like imagination is a big knowledge project. And so collectively, if it all goes in, you know, what would be fucking cool, man? It also means that we could totally seven years from now, like, say, who wants to take on the shop for the next decade? Yeah, gift it. You know, and you could gift this huge infrastructure. Like, once we go, we find the right, like, if it's Patagonia or someone else, to be like, yeah, we're going to put, we're going to do video economics. And, like, that's the, you know, who's the next iconic who's sustainable by that point or trying to chase that like and you go okay build this function in and we've found a partnership and this tool this platform's going to go but it's all the stuff doesn't have to die the knowledge which is the whole goal you know like can you so this is total collective knowledge stack can go to a place where – yeah, so I think it's the shot. I just think that's – it's finally the shot. And that would be the test to work out how to – and then I think if we – I mean, this feels like the sort of thing that you could hand to on dress and they could do next and you could play with together and just be um but we just get it this is you know in terms of landing in it um it's also we can feed all of this we can immediately now we have the game complete like this can go into fortnite this can go these principles can go so we can have our shop we can also sign partnerships with other shops and be like, all right, cool, Olympics. Like, yeah, we're going to do a shoe together and this is how you do it. And then just all you're changing at the other end is what goes into the card. Because, yeah, you could open up that opportunity for any game to create their own API, take access hoodies and then characters. So Guardians can have this tomorrow, for example. Yeah. You know, and that's what they're missing. They're missing the knowledge stack. But like all the IK, if you have everything, as long as we have admin people, which is what we're trying to hire, to make sure all the knowledge goes into the right playgrounds, then this is it. And it's, yeah, and it's full open source with stacks of governance. Yep. And we're the ones that, and then we lock it off. Like that would be the interesting thing seven years from now, just go, we lock this one off, that's done. That was that body of work. So this shop is based on this knowledge and that's just a text other people you can take the tools and the process but it creates a you know if you fucking do like a proper smart like contract access to the back end or whatever but just like no you can't infect this like you can't go and put fucking right wing crazy text in here this is just like quarantine in a forever chain that this is now locked away um and here's the custodians that can take on the shop um and yeah i think you just need and here's here's open source you know here's how we do it in trusted ways but then here's the open source access like yeah and then you just need like um it's almost like levels of understanding of the system so that you have the right people being like this this is how things are ingested and implemented you just need that almost like a collection like five people or something that understands the ecosystem so that then people can see other people who are it's like on dress layer three admin people we hire yeah yeah yeah that's like you know and sammy like they're there yeah and and you like you know Siaka, like it's a fucking, the people that can shepherd this stuff is. Yeah. It'd be super cool to see how can we get a shop, how do you get a transaction from that gaming piece? Yeah. So how do you get the user experience, like human experience? I log in. I'm now in the knowledge universe. And, you know, I'm in the shop that money I'm in the moneyless shop and just to go and play and I got 100 points and that got me this hoodie I reckon that'd be that's the final piece which would be fucking amazing yeah why don't like I suppose that's the challenge right by say Thursday there's a I suppose that's the challenge, right, by, say, Thursday. There's a... The main thing, I guess, is making sure this is totally open source so people can access and play with it, which it already semi is. Second is documentation, so that's already pretty close. And then... Yeah, and anywhere it says Indigenous custodianship, I just have Indigenous systems. I just have like Indigenous systems. I'd have Indigenous custodianship, mentoring and imagination. That just keeps us safe. Like, and you've got... Because I don't want to be positioned as the Indigenous custodianship group. Yeah. Like, it's always custodianship, mentoring, imagination. Like, that's what we've done for 20 years. And this is a 30-year project on that. So top level, universal access to custodianship, mentoring and imagination. And, you know, these category, like big category areas for organisations to move, like as play, like those, so the first three, and then there's the 200, like the next 10 years will give us 280 different deep case studies. They'll give us 130 systems change citizens. They'll give us 150 individual tools. They'll give us five really deep movements of 1,000 different entities and that will be our, like that's the next decade. And the last decade is based on work across a variety of frames and forms from the television show to like different, yeah, like books and texts and research and all that shit. It's fucking cool, man. But it kind of gets – there'd be the challenge either side, I reckon, in terms of distillation. I can't believe I'm saying this, but like I think there is like the one pager at the start of just going, this is the knowledge universe. It's two-thirds of the way through. This is what it was before, you know, imagination, custodianship, and just use iconography. Like here's a couple of icons, you know, some mentoring program, TV show, books, different things that have been fed into it, like some of the just thematics of what's happened or a couple of examples. And then the next seven years is going to be, or we're 23 years through, the next seven years is going to be these 250 elements that we already know. There'll be 150 tools like Imagine Film or the Mentor Credit, UNC5. There'll be 150, 130 systems change citizens like Heliogenesis or residents and projects. And then there'll be five deep action visa case studies on how to organise the key entities and the earth can move differently to get to relation. And we think those will help unlock $125 trillion nature-centred economy. It's just like one plus one equals three, you know, like it becomes the front page of the website potentially. And in the interim, you can play the game. Like how do we move it? Well, we need knowledge to be valued and nature-centred. So instead of a coin and it being transactional, cross that out. Here's a hoodie. You can head over to the moneyless shop and you can engage in exchanges of time, knowledge, opportunities. We know this shit. This was two years ago. And you can unlock a hoodie. And all the time, knowledge, and opportunities are about imagination, custodianship, and mentoring, and they orient us in the right way. Someone takes a default setting survey, gets 10 points. Like when i fucking you know in terms of going and doing this like someone can play here on the aim site where they could play in the fortnight world that we built and they could do that i don't have to go to the musicians fucking gathering they can just go and play fortnight for an hour yeah i'll buy a hoodie for now. Yep. Bye, Woody. Yeah, my... It's funny how quickly you kind of move past things, but, like, my... From sitting and talking with people in community especially, you get an understanding exactly of what they want and need, but the translation of that into this Western system and like system of competition, it breaks so quickly. And so like that whole conversation you just had, it creates what's required digitally. It changes the whole fucking thing. Yeah. Yeah, and what you're moving is you're moving the product from the start to manipulate to the knowledge of the way that you unlock the product. Yeah. And you can say like in the visualisation at the front, it doesn't just have to be a hoodie, guys. So this can unlock. That's what Virgin Australia have done with their fucking, like, frequent flyers. Of course. It's what we said at the beginning. It can get you housing. It can get you, like, this credit system. We're building our own points system. And then over time, we just ask other people that want to come and drop into the shop. Like, you know, yeah, and we've got a new release in the shop now, guys. Like, this person's offering housing. There's 10 houses available. 10 eco homes are available now. Head over to the shop. They're worth 1,000 points each. We just fucking, like, aim as a shop. We just haven't had this. But, like, you know, you can... All the partners in the next seven years, we spend our time stimulating the shop. There's seven positions to go to travel to the United States, to go to the UN. Go to the shop. Do the work. I want to unlock a golden ticket. Like, you you know even the golden ticket's probably not the right path but fucking hoodies hoodies hoodies it's just like and then we go like mate yeah someone hacked the joycourt without like that's that's the other thing people want to move at speed accredit yourself as a joycourt i don't want to go i don't want to spend a year in imagination someone just does it. Accredit yourself as an Indigenous Knowledge Systems Lab. Like, Shane will just do that. He's the sort of mind that would just do that and get his hoodie. Sydney just does a fucking stamp in Bulambi and goes to Australia Post. Like, it's the, this is it. Hmm. It's getting people there, isn't it? The film gets people there. Oh, yeah, like it's... I think what I mean is like once people are actively participating in this, they get to understand that system of bartering or like relation that they've been missing. Like people just don't understand until they start doing it like actually yeah but all the like most of the gameplay stuff is still reductive no like people don't get to learn yeah you know it's not about knowledge or moving yeah yeah i think being able to i think setting this up as like a like a business case would be would be super interesting and then lining up a call like for you and me to present it to like 10 people in the team yeah for sure maybe that's like the board of different people to do that this week and just go like we hacked the business case to go this is what it looks like api here would be five of the clients like short term um guardians could take this tomorrow and they could build this into their own Game 5 world. Second one, Fortnite is one. Longer term, like seven years from now, you could give this to Nike or you could give this to, you know, Patagonia and say, this is how you run a moneyless shop. You could do that in parallel. We could just give it to them and they could do it for different products. And you could have an open source challenge to see how many moneyless shops, like the Hoodie Economics Challenge you could run at COP in 2030. As part of our death date, you could run the Hoodie Economics Challenge to see who's going to win the shop in the last year. You know, who gets the custodianship of the AIM shop and the domain and that the others get to do it by creating their own case studies. Like you have organisations small and large around the world that are competing to do it. But just painting that and just going, this is what this is. This is taking it. So what do we need to do? You need administrators of the platform that organise the knowledge properly, which is your first slide you showed me. Yeah. And that no one else has to, three admin people have to understand that. Yeah. Yeah. And then, you know, as long as you do that, then you show you already have the knowledge, like, coming, here are the river runs. You know, you've got these river runs of input, then you're going to have 150 tools you can put in through the university. You're going to have the five action visas through imagination, through the books and what they contribute. And then you're going to have the 130 systems change residents through the video. So as long as you do look after the knowledge books on graduation and their submissions, as long as you get those two icons, as long as you get a video from the systems change residents, and as long as you get the tool into a format that can be ingested, then you've got the extra stacks that will contribute to the deepening of this knowledge frame. I'm pretty keen. And then you put 10,000 hoodies to it. Like what the recommendation right now is that the 10,000 hoodies get activated into a shop over the course of the next seven years. And you just have like, you know, you introduce a mail-out component, which is the hoodie economic shop. It's a hoodie that money can't buy. The most meaningful hoodie on the earth. Like it's the deck that we want to try and do and then you just share the latest players those people have been in the shop and what they've unlocked and it's all automated feeds back here's kylie she did she got 100 points during the week here's jimmy he just accredited himself as a joy corp and that's just an admin piece someone just does that that's not siaka it's just like one of the new eas just does that as an admin piece and rinses and repeats it every second tuesday and there i think is in a boat you know that is a handover gift ben is like fuck yeah you weren't your custodianship, buddy. So I can just focus on this for the week? Yes. Just do this. Cool. Yeah. Just get a, like, maybe we can just get a, find a, Maybe we can just get a Find a Let's get a A call with You, me, Leia Steph, Siaka Sammy And Christy and Mark Brentall and Jake. So I'll just do that now. So that's Sam, Christy, Steph, Siaka, Ben, Jake, Mark, Siaka, And PJ. PJ. Can you do it tomorrow, then? After 3.30? Yeah. All right, Paul? Yeah, sorry. Great. Kick ass on it. Let's finish this thing. Shop. Audio economics. Imagination. Go on, you, Ben. Thanks, brother. let's finish this thing shop audio economics imagination good on you ben thanks brother",
